# Image-Video-Processing-OpenCV-Cpp

## 1. Objective

To demonstrate various image and video processing and applications using OpenCV with C++ API. These applications include reading and visualizing image and video files as well as live video stream, color space conversion, smoothing, denoising, thresholding, edge detection, feature detections. We also demonstrate a quick prototyping of face detection and recognition application using Haar Cascades OpenCV functionalities.
