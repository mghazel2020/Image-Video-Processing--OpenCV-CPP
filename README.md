# Image-Video-Processing-OpenCV-Cpp

## 1. Objective

To demonstrate various image and video processing and applications using OpenCV with C++ API. These applications include reading and visualizing image and video files as well as live video stream, color space conversion, smoothing, denoising, thresholding, edge detection, feature detections. We also demonstrate a quick prototyping of face detection and recognition application using Haar Cascades OpenCV functionalities. 

## 2. OpenCV Installation and Visual Studio Project Setup

* The latest OpenCV version with C++ API can be downloaded from [opencv.org](https://opencv.org/releases/)

* Step by step detailed instructions of configuaring the latest download OpenCv for Windows version (OpenCV â€“ 4.5.1) for Visual Studio 2019 Project (Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16.9.0) can be found here [here](https://medium.com/@subwaymatch/opencv-410-with-vs-2019-3d0bc0c81d96)
