# Image-Video-Processing-OpenCV-Cpp

## 1. Objective

To demonstrate various image and video processing and applications using OpenCV with C++ API. These applications include reading and visualizing image and video files as well as live video stream, color space conversion, smoothing, denoising, thresholding, edge detection, feature detections. We also demonstrate a quick prototyping of face detection and recognition application using Haar Cascades OpenCV functionalities.

## 2. OpenCV Installation and Visual Studio Project Setup

* The latest OpenCV version with C++ API can be downloaded from [opencv.org](https://opencv.org/releases/).

* Step by step detailed instructions of configuaring the latest download OpenCv for Windows version (OpenCV â€“ 4.5.1) for Visual Studio 2019 Project (Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16.9.0) can be found: [here](https://medium.com/@subwaymatch/opencv-410-with-vs-2019-3d0bc0c81d96)

## 3. Image Processing 

In this section, we shall illustrate the output of several basic image processing OpenCV built-in functionalties. 

### 3.1 Loading, Visualizing and Saving Images

We shall use the commonly used input image of Lena, as illustrated next.


<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img align="center" height="300" src="images/lena.jpg">
  </div>
</div>


#### 3.2 Image Smoothing 

We explored the performnce of the following OpenCV built-in image smoothing a;lgorithms:
* Homogenous bluring
* Gaussian blurring
* Median blurring
* Box filter bluring.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Homogeneous Blur </td>
    <td> <img src="figures/lena_homogeneous_blur_filter_size_11x11.jpg" height="300"  ></td>
   </tr> 
   <tr>
    <td> Gaussian Blur </td>
    <td> <img src="figures/lena_gaussian_blur_filter_size_11x11.jpg" height="300"  ></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Median Blur </td>
    <td> <img src="figures/lena_median_blur_filter_size_11x11.jpg" height="300"  ></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Box Filter Blur </td>
    <td> <img src="figures/lena_boxFilter_blur_filter_size_11x11.jpg" height="300"  ></td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### 3.3 Image Denoising

We explored the performnce of the following OpenCV built-in image denoising a;lgorithms:
* Bilateral filtering
* Non-local means filtering.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Noisy Image </td>
    <td> <img src="figures/original_noisy_image.jpg" width="500"  ></td>
   </tr> 
   <tr>
    <td> Bilateral Filter </td>
    <td> <img src="figures/input_img_BILATERAL FILTERING_filter_size_21x21.jpg" width="500"  ></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Non-Local Means Filter </td>
    <td> <img src="figures/input_img_ NON_LOCAL_MEANS_FILTERING_filter_size_101x101.jpg" width="500"  ></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### 3.4 Image thresholding

OpenCV offers the function threshold to perform thresholding operations.We can effectuate 5 types of Thresholding operations with this function, as illuatred [here](https://www.docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/threshold/threshold.html?highlight=basic%20thresholding%20operations). 

The results of the thresholding are sensitive to the type of applied threshold operation and the value of the selected threshold value. In order to experment with the different combinations of the thresholding type and value, OpenCV allow us to create TrackBar User Interface, which allows the user to select these paramaters settings and automatically generate and display the thresholding results correcting to the user selcted settings.
